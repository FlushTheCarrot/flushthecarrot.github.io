## Current Projects

### StickyPallet 
**Simple Color Palette Generator.**

  ![alt text](/MEDIA/LINKEDICON.png)

I made StickyPallet my first official paid software, as there aren’t many one-time purchase options of its class. I decided to go ahead and fully program **StickyPallet** as my first **actual** published software.

- [Graphics Editor](MEDIA/GraphicsTest.html) 

I have programmed **StickyPallet** from the ground up using **100% Python**.

### Godot HTML5 Project
**Interactive Godot Project Demo.**

- [Play the Godot Project](path/to/your/htmlfile.html)
